# USAGE:
# cis_send hwxx ta_pennkey

# hwxx is the name of a directory with a text file titled student_pennkey for each
# student you wish to send email to.
 
# In the directory which contains hwxx there should be 2 files present: preamble.txt postamble.txt
# These files are prepended and appended accordingly to your style comments within the message.

# The student's name will be extracted from the database and prepended to the email with a 
# customized greeting. The TA will be bcc'd on each email, for their own records.

# Example:
#	ls . ->
#	 	pramble.txt - contains the introduction (here are your grades etc.)
#    	postamble.txt - conatins the conclusion and signature (best, Stephanie)
#	 	hw04
#			jschaf - contains the comments for jschaf's hw (No mistakes!)
#			noamz

# 	./cis_send hw04 sweirich

# Output Email:
# 	Hi Joe,
# 
# 	here are your grades etc.
#
# 	No mistakes!
#
# 	best, Stephanie
